# Archived MCP Prompts

This directory contains the prompt content from the waymark MCP server's
`waymark.tldr` and `waymark.todo` prompts. These prompts were removed as part of
simplifying the MCP interface to a single-tool pattern.

The content here serves as guidance for future skill development.

## Files

- `tldr-prompt.md` - Guidance for drafting TLDR waymarks
- `todo-prompt.md` - Guidance for drafting TODO waymarks

## Migration Context

- **Issue**: #95 (Move CLI help/prompt text to raw files)
- **Related**: #117 (skills), #118 (CLI), #119 (MCP single-tool)
- **Pattern**: Moving from MCP prompts to Claude Code skills
- **Date**: 2025-01-05
