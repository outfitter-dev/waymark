# LINEAR.md

## Project

- Team: Waymark (subteam of Outfitter)
- ID: `WM`
- Project: `Waymark v0.1`

## Rules

- This project uses Linear for project management. By default, issues should be created in Linear first. Creating GitHub issues is also important, but should come secondary to Linear.
- When working with GitHub issues, use a `<magic word> <linear ID>` to reference the corresponding Linear issue.
