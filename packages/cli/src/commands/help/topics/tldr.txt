TLDR WAYMARKS

Purpose:
  File-level summary of what the module does.

Guidelines:
  - Only one tldr per file
  - Place it at the top (after shebang or frontmatter)
  - Use 8-14 words, active voice
  - Focus on capability and scope

Examples:
  // tldr ::: handles billing webhooks and retries failed deliveries
  <!-- tldr ::: summarizes API contract and usage for this doc -->
