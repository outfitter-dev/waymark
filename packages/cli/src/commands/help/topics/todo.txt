TODO WAYMARKS

Use for actionable work that still needs to happen.

Guidelines:
  - Start with a verb and be specific
  - Include ownership with mentions (@alice)
  - Use tags for grouping (#perf, #security)
  - Use ~todo for in-progress work, *todo for high priority

Examples:
  // todo ::: add request signing for webhook payloads #security
  // ~todo ::: refactor cache invalidation @alice
  // *todo ::: ship v2 migration guide #docs
