SIGNALS

Signals are single-character prefixes that change the priority or state.

^ raised
  In-progress or blocking work. Should be empty before merging to main.

* starred
  Important or high priority.

Rules:
  - Signals come before the type with no space
  - Order is ^ then * when combined (e.g., ^*todo)

Examples:
  // ^todo ::: stabilize cache layer
  // *fix ::: avoid leaking tokens in logs
