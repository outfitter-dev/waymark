SIGNALS

Signals are single-character prefixes that modify a waymark's meaning.

~ flagged
  Marks work actively in-progress on the current branch.
  - "I'm currently working on this"
  - "Don't forget this before merging"
  Should be cleared before merging to main.

* starred
  Marks high-priority or important items.
  - "This is important"
  - "Pay attention to this"

The pair tells a complete story:
  todo     A todo
  *todo    An important todo
  ~todo    A todo I'm working on
  ~*todo   An important todo I'm working on

Rules:
  - Signals come before the type with no space
  - Order is ~ then * when combined (e.g., ~*todo)

Examples:
  // ~todo ::: stabilize cache layer
  // *fix ::: avoid leaking tokens in logs
  // ~*fix ::: critical bug I'm actively fixing
